# xckd_app

The "XKCD" app exercise from the book [*Programming Flutter*](https://pragprog.com/titles/czflutr/programming-flutter/) (with a fun typo in the app name!)

## Requirements

Recommended Flutter development environment:

- VS Code
- [Flutter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) for VS Code

## Running

Run `main.dart` from within VS Code.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Run `flutter test`
- Or, from within `test/unit_test.dart`, run an individual test in VS Code

### Integration Tests

Note that integration tests make real network requests instead of mocking.

Run `flutter drive --target=test_driver/selectionpage.dart`
